This is the second half of a one-year seminar on computational behavioral and social science. In the last semester, we reviewed the common scientific methods and some major results in four distinct branches of behavioral and social sciences. We have also talked about the general philosophical issues of scientific confirmation and explanation in the philosophy of science literature. In this semester, we will investigate the naturalistic methodology of social science. More specifically, we will examine how to apply the theory of complexity and dynamic systems to social sciences. If time allowed, we will examine further the principles of causal inferences in social sciences.

Topics to be covered: 
* Dynamic systems
* Social complexity
* Emergence
* Causality
